1. When I was implementing Howler, I ran into the challenge of finding a user by both username and id. Some methods, such as finding the users that a user is following require search by id since follows.json is formatted to use user id. Navigating to a user's profile, however, requires search by username since this is what is included in the URL. While I ended up simply creating another endpoint that used a different path and method in my followsDAO, I felt this solution was somewhat lacking in that creating an api/user-by-username path separate from the api/user path was not optimal. Were I to do this assignment again, I would search for another method to solve this issue.
2. One additional feature I would add to Howler is proper authentication. As of right now, any account can be accessed just by knowing the username, and this opens up the system to potential vulnerabilities. Were I to implement proper authentication, I would use the token method described in class to authorize users to access their accounts and prevent malicious users from gaining unauthorized access
